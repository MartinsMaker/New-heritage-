# NEW HERITAGE MANIFESTO

This repository will be used to share leather patterns of vintage military equipment.
Sharing this content has three main objectives:

1) Promoting the conversion of military-made pieces of equipment and garments to hopefully share 
   the idea that something made for war can find a better and more meaningful use during peace, ultimately representing a protest against all forms of violence. 

2) Improving the accessibility to self-made accessories and garments, fighting the rise of fast fashion,
   labour exploitation and  resource waste by also using natural/eco-friendly materials as much as possible for every project.

3) Avoiding the loss of historical pieces of equipment by freely sharing patterns and blueprints.

## STRUCTURE

Every build will be documented on my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/@martins-117, where you can find the restoration process, during which I will also share a bit of the history behind each item.
The second part will be dedicated to the redesign, which revolves around improving and adapting the vintage design to create a separate new updated version, aiming to merge fascinating vintage style with practicality.

# LET'S LEARN TOGETHER!

This is an open-source project, and everyone is invited to use the patterns and the data shared on this repository
I'm not a professional leather worker nor a designer, so if you have more experience to share, you are more than welcome to do so.
During the videos, I will describe every step, trying to keep a beginner-friendly approach by sharing some tips and tricks that I learned over time.

## THE IDEA BEHIND THE PROJECT

NEW HERITAGE is an undoubtedly ambitious project that aims to empower people over the system, and even 
if it may seem pretentious I personally think that sometimes to bring change to the world a bit of arrogance 
is needed.
If showing as an ammunition pouch may be more useful carrying flowers instead of bullets, and thinking of stimulating even a small change in the way we see the world means to be arrogant, well, I am the most arrogant person on the planet.
This is my project, and if you like it stick around.
