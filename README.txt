# NEW HERITAGE MANIFESTO

This repository will be used to share leather patterns of vintage military equipment.
Sharing this content has three main objectives:

1) Promoting the conversion of military-made pieces of equipment and garments to hopefully share 
   the idea that something made for war can find a better and more meaningful use during peace.

2) Improving the accessibility to self-made accessories and garments, fighting the rise of fast fashion
   and resources waste by also using natural/eco-friendly materials as much as possible for every project.

3) Avoiding the loss of historical pieces of equipment by freely sharing patterns and blueprints.

Every build will be documented on my youtube channell https://www.youtube.com/@martins-117 where you can find the restoration process during which I will also try to tell a bit of the history behind every item.
The second part will be dedicated to the redesign, which revolves around improving and adapting the vintage design to create a separate new updated version, trying to merge fascinating vintage style and practicality.

NEW HERITAGE is an undoubtedly ambitious project that aims to empower people over the system, and even 
if it may seem pretentious I personally think that sometimes to bring change to the world some arrogance 
is needed.
If showing as an ammunition pouch may be more useful carrying flowers instead of bullets, and thinking of stimulating even a small change in the way we see the world means to be arrogant, well, I am the most arrogant person on the planet.
